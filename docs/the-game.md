# The Game

John slammed his card on the table. Queen of Spades. Trump Card. He could feel the moisture gathering on his top lip and he raised his hand to wipe it off. Bid Wiz. Nobody knew why it caused such extremes of emotion, it would turn the most docile person into a raving lunatic. And don’t even think of playing for money, cause its not worth your life reneging for a coupla quarters. Bid Wiz was the last thing John needed. He was already tense, it only fed his anger.

He looked across to Daniel, who sat, still smirking like a fucking idiot, with a card stuck to his forehead. John fought every instinct in his body to resist knocking it off. And the room rocked. Rocked with the movement of bodies jamming, bodies grinding, bodies dancing a mating call -- while the music drummed against his skull and incessant chattering--like flies--buzzed around his head. The smell of popcorn and sweat filled his flared nostrils and made him feel sick. Coming to this party had been a bad idea, playing against Daniel was insanity.

He glanced at Tré, his partner, who swayed with the rhythms of Heavy D., Arrested Development, and Salt-n-Pepa. His dark fingers tapped against the table while his full lips shaped the words “Don't cha know I wanna shoop, Baby?” as they came through the stereo. Every now and then he would glance into the crowd of dancing bodies to keep track of his lady friend in the bright yellow dress. The one he had introduced, simply, as Juelle--Jewel, like she was some kinda prize. One of them spiritual girls who got drunk on dancing, who couldn’t resist the sounds of drums pounding, like a heart-beat, like a lovers call, making her body move across the dance floor--like she was possessed by one of them old time spirits. Her aura was like an erotic perfume that filled the room and called the men to her.

John realized that Tré would not be able to resist her for too much longer. The pace of the game would have to increase and that made John nervous. He liked to take his time, he didn't want to be rushed into making mistakes.

Daniel laughed taking a card from his hand. “Nobody told you to cut with the Queen when you know I'm outa diamonds.” He tossed an ace over the Queen becoming even more smug as he gathered the cards with more emphasis than necessary.

Daniel’s partner, Cheryl, began to giggle. Her high cheekbones rose even higher to hide her dark brown eyes, where tears hid in the corners threatening to fall. John hated the way she bit her lower lip in an attempt to stifle laughter. Bitch. Like she was too good to let loose like everyone else in the room. Even more, he hated those stupid dimples that appeared every time Daniel was near. As if by his presence the sun was moved to travel through the sky.

Daniel led with the four of hearts.

Juelle sashayed up to the table. She placed her long, manicured fingers over Tré’s shoulders. With her mauve colored lips pouting slightly, she leaned close to his ear. “You gonna be done soon, baby?”

John noted how beautiful she was. How creamy her honey-colored skin looked against the yellow of her cocktail dress and the dark chocolate of Tré. How her curves filled the dress while her long legs seemed to stretch forever bellow the short hem line. Her brown hair fell in curls around her face and for an instant he caught her hazel eyes. She turned quickly, her voice deeper as she spoke again.

“I wanna dance with you.”

“You gonna play or what?” John couldn’t keep the hostile tone from his voice. If Tré noticed this tone, he didn’t show it. He leaned closer to Juelle whispering in her ear. His hand reached out to caress her lower back. She smiled in response, nodded and headed back to the dance area. Her eyes intent on him she began whining her hips in a seductive fashion.

Tré only turned back to the game. His eyes betrayed that he’d rather be dancing, but the rest of his features fell in line with the serious Bid Wiz player. He leaned forward resting his right arm on the table, his hands curving the cards so those beside him could not see them, his brows furrowed while the fingers on his left hand tapped his bottom lip. He placed the Ace of Hearts next to Daniel’s four.

With a shrug Cheryl lay down a three of hearts.

John let a smile shape his lips as he flashed the six of hearts. Take that asshole. He gathered the cards into his book. Tré led with the Queen of Clubs and Cheryl followed with the Two of Clubs.

John felt the sweat gathering again on his lips. His throat was dry and he reached for his beer to dampen it. The liquid felt cool against his tongue, but the smell accosted him. It lingered behind mixing with the smell of honey-pineapple ham on the table behind him. And the onion-garlic dip, Doritos, potato salad, popcorn, banana pudding and pumpkin pie all mingled with more popcorn being made, and more sweet dripping from the dancers--making them stale and their perfumes clash. Fuck it all! John felt the bile rise in his stomach. His hands were shaking, blurring the cards before him.

He glanced at Tré, aware that his attention had once more turned to Juelle. He glanced at Cheryl. She was biting her bottom lip again and all signs of the red lipstick she had worn was gone. Her eyes, glassy with excitement, were on Daniel. John turned to stare at the card on Daniel’s forehead. It was a Joker. He knew it had to be that goddamn joker. His anger grew. Why the fuck doesn’t he just play it? Why’d he have to act like an asshole pasting it to his forehead? Who told him he was anything special anyway, with his poc-marked face?

John’s hand shook harder. He held the Ace, but he wasn’t sure. If Daniel was out of clubs... Shit! He realized suddenly how much he hated this game. How much he hated them--everyone at the party for making him feel this way. And Cheryl, the uptight cow. But most of all, Daniel.

The bodies moved on the dance floor shaping the light and John became aware of a flash of metal behind him. It’s edges were soaked with juice from the ham. He became more aware of his own body, the muskiness of it and the Cool Water cologne seeming, suddenly, too strong. His hands continued to shake as he pulled the ace and lay it on the table.

Daniel began laughing as he reached for the card on his forehead.

John moved swiftly, before Daniel could lay the card down, and grabbed the knife. He placed it bellow Daniel’s throat, the point poking him and drawing blood. Behind him, he heard Cheryl screaming. His smile grew as he nodded, let her scream.

The room was suddenly silent. Still. Without music. Those who had been dancing or talking on the couch gathered around him. Their faces were tight with anxiety. John knew they feared his temper. But they didn’t understand, it was that game. It was all about the game. People had gotten killed for less crap than Daniel had pulled. But they didn’t know. To them, Bid Wiz was nothing more than Rummy. But he’d school them. School was in session and he was ready to teach. And he knew they wouldn’t stop him. They wouldn’t fucking try to stop him. He knew it. He counted on it.

Tré spoke softly to him. “Come on man, he ain’t worth all this.”

John saw the terror growing in Daniel’s eyes, turning them black and wet.

“Did I read you right?” John asked, his laugh full of venom. He’d show Daniel what happens to anyone trying make a fool of him. He leaned forwards peering into Daniel’s eyes. “You been on my ass all night. You fucking want a piece, come on then.”

Daniel lips moved, leaking silent words.

“What? You got somethin to say brotha?”

“P..Pl..Please.”

“Please what?” John eyes were shining now, damp and feverish.

“Come on man.” Tré repeated, taking a step forward. Cheryl was still whimpering. It was as if only the four of them were the there, the rest of the room was that silent. No one dared move. John knew the only one that would possibly try to stop him was Tré.

“Stay outa this man.” John warned. He chanced a glance at him then returned his gaze back to Daniel.

“Wanted to play the big man. What to act like you all that.”

Daniel tried to move, but John was ready with the knife. He pressed it harder against Daniel’s throat letting a small drop of blood escape. But that blood. It was like waving red before a bull. His anger grew.

John’s whole life was like this game. He saw that now. Every time he got ready to play his ace, some clown was up there smiling with a joker pasted to his forehead. School, work, with the honeys. It didn’t matter. He got trumped at every turn. He was raging inside. Raging against all those years getting nowhere. He wanted to scream. He wanted out.

Daniel jerked away and the knife nicked him again. John liked the way his blood, a deep mauve, mixed with the syrupy ham juice on the blade. The smell of Daniel’s fear gave him a high that calmed his trembling fingers and filled his blood with malice. He plunged the knife in and the madness was finally silenced.
