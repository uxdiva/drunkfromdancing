# About the author
## Dara Pressley

My whole life I wanted to be a writer. And I am. I write every day, volumes of information, technical documentation, comparative analyses, justifications, use cases... on and on.

What I don't write ... fiction and poetry.  And I miss that. So I've decided it's time to get back to there. But, rather than falling into some hole and hiding out until something is good enough. I'm going to put it all here... let it develop live where any passerby can witness.

So here is **Drunk from Dancing** ... a collection of poetry and short stories.

Feel free to provide feedback, kudos, or even to share the link to the site, just remember this is my work and under my copyright.

Thanks & Enjoy.
