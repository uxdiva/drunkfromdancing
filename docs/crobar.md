# Crobar

The noise they called music met her at the parking lot. A cacophony of metal that assaulted her ears and vibrated her blood. And she thought, perhaps this had been a mistake. But she had promised the roommates a night out — so held their hands and let them pull her into the heavy metal Crobar.

Inside, the place reminded her of a warehouse. An overly large metal room, large iron pipes running across the ceiling, and iron stairwells leading to other floors. The place was filled with bodies. Pale-skinned bodies drinking, pale-skinned bodies rocking, pale-skinned bodies checking each other out in the dim strobe lights. While the sound consumed the room so that the metal of the walls and the metal of the sound seemed as one —  cold and hard and loud.

This was not her scene.

The roommates let go of her hands. They were headed to the bar to see if they could score drinks. She watched them walk away. Red haired, blond, and brunette. And for a moment, they reminded her of fairy folk. These three nymphs who brought her to this foreign world. She didn’t follow. Instead, she moved to the dance floor. Bodies were thick with people throwing themselves against the sound. Yet some how they parted enough to let her through.

She stood at their center. Hands dropped to her side, feet slightly apart, she stood still… statuesque amid all that motion. Then she closed her eyes. She listened and she waited. A guitar riff screamed out above the noise, and still she waited. The singer's voice, which had been dark and deep, screeched back an answer to the riff. And she waited. Then finally she heard it. Beneath everything else. It was a rhythm like waves, a rhythm like blood, a rhythm like the ancient gods chanting her name. The drum. She had found the drum. And finding that drum was like finding the key to the music itself. She began to understand it. She began to hear it. Not noise, but music. Music filling her soul. Music moving, finally, her hips… tapping her toes and rocking her body back and forth.

She opened her eyes slightly now. Taking it all in as the strobe lights amplified the music in her and the bodies around her played backdrop to her awakening. The music, still loud, vibrated her bones. The based moved her body while she continued to concentrate on the drums. Her head was spinning like she was drunk. She was one possessed. The spirit was riding her body, calling her horse, and consuming her will.

And that was how he first noticed her, the honey-skinned girl in the yellow top and gap jeans. And he knew what she was - a spiritual girl drunk on dancing. He began to circle the dance floor like a buzzard searching for a meal. He wanted her. She could tell he wanted her. They were two of a kind in that sea of pale bodies. His skin, a dark chocolate, looked warm and smooth even from that distance. He smiled at her as he whispered to his friends. He had a flashlight that he pointed at her. The light was bright and harsh against her slightly parted eyes. He was claiming her. He began to circle again. Pacing, trying to find away closer.

She didn’t like him, she decided. Didn’t like the way he stalked her from the darkness.

But her rider liked him.

Liked the way he claimed her with his eyes, caressed her body with his thoughts, liked the way he fucked her from the other side of the room. She danced for him now, not caring who he was as long as his eyes never left her body. Danced for him, letting him worship the goddess she was. And as the music beat in time with her heart, he was coming closer. He was coming closer. Her lips parted so she could let out the breath she had been holding. He was coming closer. A warm sensation rose from the pit of her stomach. Closer. He wove his way through the crowd in smaller and smaller circles. Closer. She moaned softly as his arms circled her waist. Closer. He rocked with her, the music moving them together as one. Closer. He leaned in towards her ear. She could smell the sweet water cologne mixing with the scent of something undeniably male. Closer. As he spoke, the vibration crashed through her like so many waves in an ocean.

“My name is Bennie.”

Tell my horse.

The spirit moved her body in response to his. Feeling his heat pressed against her. Her knees growing weak as he spoke again.

“What’s your name, baby?”

She told him. Whispered it softly, not yet ready to give herself to him.  He asked her to repeat it. The rider answered this time craving to see his mouth shape the sound of her name.

“Juelle, like some kind of diamond?”

The rider shutter inside and she felt her legs just might give out. How was she still standing. The spirit grew bolder. Possessing her completely. It moved her body with his, rubbed her body against his. And it grew frustrated. Dancing was not enough. Dancing was not enough.

The song changed and he pulled away from her to look into her eyes. “You got a number, Juelle? Can I call you some time?”

The rider nodded.

“Let me get a pen, you want a beer?” He walked away before she could answer. The rider grew angry, feeling suddenly so alone among that see of bodies dancing. She was loosing control. She focused on the drum. Focused again on that rhythm, letting it hypnotize her like the ticking of a watch. But that only pushed her further in the wrong direction. The rider grasped at her spellbound state. And she was gone, only the spirit dancing now for all who watched.

He returned with the beer. She felt the coolness of the glass touch her lips. Felt the sensation of the liquid coat her tongue and slip down her throat. The slightly bitter taste of fermented wheat, the only reminder, the alcohol taken by the spirit skipped her completely. Drunk enough on the dance, she had no need of it anyway. Bennie danced close once again. And she didn’t stop him as his hands explored her. A caress on her shoulder, a grab to her behind. The music accommodating, slowing to a ballad allowing them to get closer still. He pulled her against him. Her and the spirit were of like minds now. And she was ready.

He leaned into her ear and whispered… “Why don’t we go somewhere more quiet and talk.”

The rider bucked.

She shook her head no.

Just keep dancing.

She wanted to tell him. The magic was in the music and the movement. But he insisted. “Come on baby, I want to talk to you. Get to know you.”

He lead her to an upstairs bar. It was vacant, everyone else crounding the downstairs bar and dance floor. It was quieter there with the music muted through the doorway.

"Umm, baby, I cain’t take my eyes off you."

She felt the spirit ebbing from her body. She wasn’t dancing any more and the goddess left in search for another.  And as he talked to her, his words seemed to fly over her head. She simply nodded to his “baby” this and “baby” that. The come down — the hangover. She rested her head in the palm of her hands and wondered where the roommates had gone. Wondered how they had set her on this path and then left her to fend for herself. While he kept talking on and on. A smoother talker. Too smooth. A girl could get in a lot of trouble with a guy like him.

She pulled her fingers through her tousled locks, stood and gave him a big smile. “It’s been real nice, Bennie. Thank you.” Then she walked away.

He should have kept her dancing. He could of had anything if he had kept her dancing. But she was herself again. And he was not her type.
