# The Creator

First there was only darkness.

Then she planted his seed

and with the singularity of her will

nurtured me into existence.

I was the answer to a question

she hadn't realized she had asked.

What is it like to be free.

Because,

even though she held

the sun in her smile,

the rain in her tears,

the earth in the palm of her hand,

she didn't believe in

the possibility of her power.

They had simply convinced her

that she was some one else.

She had been blinded once,

and though she had gained her vision,

she had never gained her sight.

She had come along way to see

that she was made in the image of God.

But failed to understand

that she was more than an image.

Failed to see that

she was creation creating.

And that through her

a universe had come forth.

A miracle pulled into the gravity of

her existence.

Who's laws of motion were set

according to her rhythm.

And yet still,

she denied the possibilities

of her power.

Hid away from

the awesomeness of

her will.
