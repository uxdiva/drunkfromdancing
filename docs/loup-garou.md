# Loup-Garou

Death lurked in her window--laughing. He saw it there; a looming shape in the shadows--taunting her, taunting her. In a year she had lost her husband and child. Now she sat, surrounded by candle light, sleeping potions in a bottle on the table, and death taunting her.

He wanted to take her away from all that death. He wanted to show her that there was something lasting, something she could have faith in throughout eternity. Death only laughed--a husky tenor laugh--and told him he was a fool and should let her go.

“She belongs to me, Julian.” It bared its teeth with another long laugh.

He was determined. He pushed death aside and walked into the small house. The candles created a glow around the table and sofa. She sat in the center of the sofa. The long dark plaits of her hair were falling and framing her honey brown face. She had the bottle in her hands now. She lifted it towards her mouth--hands shaking. In a flash Julian was across the room. He placed his hand over her own, shaking his head no.

She jumped. Dropping the bottle, she jumped away from him. He could smell her fright, could read the fear in her mind. In her eyes he could see his own face. His tanned skin had a strange bluish tone to it, and lineless--not just without wrinkles, but lineless as if his skin was made of porcelain. Then there were his eyes, the hazel and black and white, all looked made of glass; not human at all.

She was about to run. He could hear her thoughts telling her to run. “I mean you no harm,” he told her. Then he forced her to calm down, burrowing his thoughts into her mind.

When she was calm, he whispered softly, “Adina, you mustn’t kill yourself.”

“And what ‘ave I to live for?”

“Let me show you.”

“Eh? You t’ink I don’ know who you are? A shadow man? A Loup-garou? What tis it you can show me?”

“Come with me, Adina. Come with me.”

The calm he forced on her made her hesitate, made her even slightly curious. But underneath, that fear was still boiling, trying to erupt and move her from him. She shouldn’t be so frightened, he thought, I only mean her well.

He stepped forward and pulled her into his arms. “Come with me.” He lifted her. And as he strode out the front door he heard death laughing. “She’s mine now!” he said to death. And with that he lifted her towards the Heavens, then flew towards his home.

He had chosen to live in the jungle; in a place populated by only the wild creatures. He had made his home in the ruin of an ancient temple. There he lay her on a feather bed. It was in the very center of what had been a throne room. The ancient stone chairs still stood at the top of the stairs against the far wall. Between the chairs an archway led to a small balcony. Not far from the bed a long table with eight chairs stood. On the table were several candles. He lit them so she could see. (His eyes had no need of candles in darkness, the thin moonlight was enough.) Torches hung out from the walls all around the large room, but besides that, the room was empty.

And it was humid in that jungle, so humid. Moisture clung to everything, weighing down everything. But this only stirred the lovers of the evening--exotic birds, insects, monkeys, jungle rats were all alive with romance. And the night flowers filled the temple with their fragrance.

Julian was at Adina’s side again. He moved quickly, it unnerved her, so he sent soothing thoughts to fill her mind.

“Don’t you feel it? The jungle is alive with life. This is what there is to live for.”

He looked at her face. Her forehead was damp with sweat, but her brown eyes were deep and clear. He brushed the moisture away then caressed her light brown cheek--so warm. He ran his finger over her round lips. Then he kissed her. Softly. Then hard, pressing against her and pushing his tongue into her mouth. He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her closer. He could feel her heartbeat. It was beating faster, in rhythm with the jungle.

He pulled away and looked again into her eyes. Hunger. Hunger had replaced the fear. He let himself read her thoughts and was certain, she hungered for the life he could give her.

He kissed her again, pushing her body back into the bed. He let his hands explore her, claim her. And his lips followed his hands. The jungle helped him seduce her. Her own soft moans echoed through the temple then floated out to add to the noise of the night lovers. She reached back and tightened her fingers around the edges of the pillow, as if to hold her there, to keep her from floating away, finally, with all that heat. And her body pressed against his.

She was his now, he’d show death. With that thought he bit her nipple, then nursed--like an infant--nursed the red milk from her. Her moans grew louder, her heart beat faster. And he could see now, her memories. Her husband had fallen into one of the machines at the sugar cane factory. There wasn’t even enough of him left to bury. Not long after, her little girl died of the pox.

Adina cried as he drank these memories from her. “Let them go my love,” he whispered then continued to drink.

Finally, the flow became weak, her heartbeat slowed. She was so close to death now that there could be nothing to save her, nothing but his gift.

He bit into his own wrist, then lifted it to her lips. “Quickly now.”

She began to suck. Weakly at first, then faster, harder as her hunger built. He groaned. It was hard to let the blood go, but he let her have her fill.

She pulled away, gagging. She fell to the floor. He quickly moved to her side and held her as she vomited again and again, emptying her body of all it had needed in life. Then she began to convulse. He lifted her and put her back on the bed. He watched her tremble violently as her body died. He wished he could have spared her this, but it was part of the cycle.

He whispered to her, trying to ease her fears. He pushed his thoughts on her, certain that she couldn’t hear him. Then finally, when he could no longer read her mind, he knew it was over.

She slept. The lines disappeared from her face and the blue tone crept under her honey brown skin. She sighed, parting her lips slightly, and he could see the sharp fangs had grown. Yes, she was his now. Safe finally from death.

He watched her sleep awhile longer, then crept in next to her and found his own sleep in her arms.

She was magnificent. Julian thought that there was nothing else like her. It was as if she was moved by some deeper force. She took to her nature right away, even leading him in their conquests. And her powers were strong. In the beginning she merely grabbed her victims, dominating them with her strength. For her first kill, she returned to her hometown, Port-of-Spain. A man walked through the streets; his girlfriend by his side. Adina flew from the darkness and grabbed the man. And while she sucked his blood, she held the girl close to her to keep her from screaming. Then when she exhausted his blood, she turned on the girl.

Later, she began playing with her victims--the way a cat toys with a mouse. Pouncing, then letting them loose so that she could pounce again. Then finally, when they were exhausted and she had grown bored, she would feed.

One young man she chased across the entire “two by four” island of St. Croix. Night after night she haunted him. And the poor soul could find no solace from the church, nor the Obeah woman. Adina lurked in the window, her husky laugh taunting him, as the Obeah woman told him he was marked for death. Julian heard her say it, “Marked for death,” and he thought it was strange that she should choose these words. “Death” and Adina.

There seemed no end to her hunger. She killed them all, as one possessed. She threw their empty bodies in to the Amazon or the Caribbean Sea. She was a Loup-garou. She flew across the Caribbean, Brazil, Venezuela, Columbia...teaching them her name. All this excited Julian. To be sure, he was a killer too, but Adina was different--she made things happen.

After awhile she became contented with bringing small groups of people to the temple. “To worship me,” she would say, as if she truly was a queen.

Sacrifice. That what the poor pathetics she had captured whispered through the night. They must sacrifice to their god. Adina became their religion. And as with all religions, they thought if they were faithful to her she would keep them safe--silly humans. They even had priests, living in the temple, ready to do her bidding.

Adina no longer needed to kill, she was kept fed by sips of blood from this body and from that. Her skin no longer wore a blue undertone--kept alive by the blood of her slaves--she looked alive, as warm as she had in life. Yet she enjoyed her hunts, lurking in the windows and laughing at the poor victimes inside. Even among her followers there would be the sacrifice, every now and then, to remind them of her power.

Those were happy times for Julian. He watched her, sometimes feeding along side her, and baskeing in her glory. Their ancient temple was alive again, and the people worshiped at their feet. And the years passed. Adina’s followers had created a nation to worship her, all of them kept secret in this forgotten part of the jungle. The people built houses made of banana leaves and learned to live the ancient ways of the Natives who had built that temple. That was Adina’s wish, after all.

Julian marveled in the shadow of her glory. He thought it would go on this way forever. Yet at the same time he began to wonder about her powers, wonder how she was so strong that not even the sun could defy her. She was not like him at all. But something bigger.

On the day of the first sacrifice in many moons, the village was alive before dawn. Julian could hear them, rattling through the jungle, as they began to prepare for the big fête. They began by cleaning. They swept out their huts, then cleared the footpaths and the common areas, while singing for Adina to come cleanse their village of evil spirits. Then they bathed themselves thoroughly, and painted their faces the colors of the earth--in that way becoming earth bound. They began to cook a huge feast that flavored the aroma of the jungle.

As the day wore on, their songs became louder. Drums were added and rattles and wooden flutes. Some wore costume to look like the animals of the jungle, some to look like evil spirits. And this carnival paraded through the streets of the town.

The people grew drunk with dancing. Julian watched them through the temple window. Their bodies were tired, but some how they kept moving, caught up in the spirit. They were trying to clear their minds--trying to prepare themselves for Adina’s wisdom. And each time the sun moved in the sky they became more frantic.

Finally, the chosen was brought out. A little girl, just turned four that moon. She was clothed in a simple white dress, like a christening gown. On her left cheek was a tattoo of a moon. She had worn it since birth to show that she belonged to Adina. In her short life she had been spoiled, overindulged, as if she was Adina herself. Now it was time. Sacrifice.

She was laid on a litter with flowers. The villagers paraded her through the streets so that all eyes could see her. And as the sun began to set, she was marched up the temple steps.

Adina sat in her throne. She wore a crown upon her head. A long dress made of pearls covered her body. Julian had gotten it for her sometime ago, and she wore it always, at times like this. The pearls fit against the curves of her body then fanned out behind her in a long train. They clicked against the stairs as she walked down them.

She stood in the center of the temple--where their bed had been before Julian moved it to more private quarters. The litter was set at her feet. She looked at the small child who’s small eyes were filled with innocence. Not reverence or fear, but innocence. Adina had not seen that in a long time. and Julian knew it had been foolish of them to bring such a small child before her. Even though he could no longer read her mind, he knew this little miss was reminding her of her own lost one. In all the years of feeding, Adina had never once touched small children.

Adina brushed her hand against the tattoo on the child’s cheek, then she simply turned away. She walked the stairs to her throne--pearls clicking behind her--sat down and was quiet.

“Perhaps, she not to you likin’?” a village man asked.

Adina didn’t even know his name. She didn’t know any of their names. What did their names matter, they were nothing to her. “Dere will be no sacrifice today.”

Julian noticed the tone of her voice. It was soft, sad. He’d never heard her like that before.

“How you mean, Miss?” The man questioned.

Adina waved him away, turning in her chair so that she could see the jungle from the window. The sun was setting over the trees, night would be here soon. And then the night lovers would begin their own fête around the village.

Julian stood from his throne and dismissed the people. “The Queen wants to be alone. You heard her. There will be no sacrifice today.”

The people left the temple. Julian could smell the fear, their thoughts questioning what it could mean that the Queen wouldn’t feed.

When they had all gone, Adina rose then walked out onto the balcony. She sat at the back of the temple where the villagers could not see her and let the night fall across her face.

That’s how Julian found her. Her pearls glistened in the moonlight, like her eyes. She was magnificent. He was beginning to believe, more and more, that he had nothing to do with her creation. She was too beautiful. A true god. But now that god was sad.

“What’s wrong Adina.”

“Why did you make me?” Her voice was so soft, he knew human ears would not have been able to pick it up. And that sadness was still there. He wanted to help her. He wished he could read her mind and see what she truly thought. He wanted to ease her fears the way he had that night--so long ago.

“Why did you make me?”

“I wanted to take you away from death.”

“Eh? How you mean?” She turned her eyes on him and they were filled with anger. “How you mean, take me away from death? Death is everyw’ere. All I eva see is blood and death. I am death!”

“Adina...” He stepped towards her.

“No!” She pulled away from him. “All dere is left of me is anger and sadness....I had a wish once. I wanted to be up in Heaven with me husband and me one-girl-chile. And you took me from dem.”

“I couldn’t let you die.”

“You took me from dem, forever!”

“I love you, Adina.”

She turned from him and faced the darkness. And the jungle was silent. There were no night lovers tonight, no fragrant flowers to call her out. Everything was silent.

Except...Death.

Julian could hear death. It was laughing at him. Laughing because it had won after all. And then the laughter seemed closer. He turned to Adina. She was laughing. She threw her head back and held her sides and laughed as if she’d never heard anything so funny. And under her feminine laughter, the husky tenor tone he knew so well could be heard. Then she turned to him. Her eyes as clear as they had been that night he made her. A smile tugged at her lips, exposing the tips of her fangs and creating dimples on her cheeks. And he knew it was true. Death had claimed her, even in the beginning. She had never belonged to him.

“I am death, Julian.”
