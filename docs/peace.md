# Peace
(To Nana, in loving memory)

A hand grips mine

tightly in the darkness.

Hold on! Hold on!

She came to me that night,

holding tightly,

whispering her good bye.

Donâ€™t let go!

We floated out the window

rising slowly,

I never saw her face

only hands grasping.

So tired, too tired,

they began to slip.

NO!!!

I reached out,

determined to hold on tightier

but there was only air,

and the voices, the voices screaming

My voice screaming,

as I fell,

back into my own body.

While,

on the other side of the country,

My grandmother found her rest.
