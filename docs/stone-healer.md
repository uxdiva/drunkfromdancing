It is hot here, too hot! My hair is heavy with moisture and sticks to my skin. I’ve given up on its sensory power and have to depend on my ears and eyes to warn me of danger.

There hasn’t been much to distract me from my journey, besides the wampoons and skirits. They slither around me while I sleep, making me dream of their sharp teeth. They try to steal the food I eat. I’ve given up on cooking anything because the smell brings them. Instead, I’ve learned to swallow the bitter taste of raw roots and borro nuts.

It seems strange to be using our language in written form. Journals, chronicles, diaries--as such--have not been kept in over two hundred years. And literature itself has been slipping from our culture, for who has need of pages of words when a thousand images can be stored in a rock. So written language has been left to laws and financial dealings.

But here, in the jungles of the Tilsa planet, there are no artists to place my story in a rock, no companions with whom to reach out and hold the mental images of my journey. There is only me here, and if I die, my truths will be buried.

I carry with me an ancient map of Tilsa and a journal chronicling the history of my people before our former Ndagí, Libby, disappeared. I’ve taken the last pages to bear witness to the rest of our story, the destruction or survival of the Hota people.

At the moment I am studying the map. It is so old that the parchment paper is turning yellow even though it has been sealed in Taic wax. It has been years since anyone has visited Mashari, no artist has stored the directions in stone, which makes this the only guide. So many of the land marks have changed that I can only trust the trail of the river I keep to my right and the journey of the sun in the red sky above.

I have been in this jungle for five full moons now and it has been even longer since I’ve seen my mother. I hope that she is alright. But I know they will not kill her until they find me. I fear that they will torture her to find my whereabouts.

Whenever I pass through a village I ask if they have heard any news from the high council. I can never be more specific than that in case they are the current Ndagi’s spies. And I do not dare call my mother telepathically because I fear that too many minds will hear my call.

I finished reading the journals my mother gave me. The language was archaic so I had to struggle with it but it gave me a good idea of the history of our planets.

It said that four thousand years ago the first space ship traveled to Tilsa. A colony of Txousa sought to escape the warring nations on Marassa by colonizing Tilsa. Their relocation, however, only dragged the Hota into the struggle for land.

Two thousand years ago the leaders of each nation gathered together in a conference for peace. But it was not long before the treaties were broken and war broke out again. By that time the Jami had become the strongest warrior nation. They had used the time of peace to train their soldiers and improve their weapons. The other nations were no match and a thousand years after the peace conference the Jami became the rulers of the twin planets.

When the Jami became rulers they chased each nation away from its Temple cities. Hota were forced to leave Mashari and it fell to ruins.

The journal continued describing how, two hundred years ago, the Jami had asked the Hota to help them rule, insisting that the Hota would make the best ambassadors out of all the nations. They wanted peace, they wanted the warring to stop.

That was the last entry. But I wonder how truthful the journal is. In comparison to some of the things my mother told me, I know there are sections which have been written with a certain political agenda in mind.

I have been dreaming of Szora the last couple of nights. I think she is trying to reach me through the pattern.

I miss her. I try not to, I know the Ndagí has corrupted her away from me. But images keep returning to my mind of the little girl who would hold my hand as we snuck behind the curtains in the temple; the girl who taught me to read the stars in the sky; and the girl who dabbed my forehead as I struggled through the beginning of transformation.

I know that she’s trying to put these images in my mind. She trying to use our friendship to gain my trust. I can feel her calling to me. But I know she is no longer that little girl I once loved. She has become another Jami, destroyer of all nations. And she will murder me as quickly as she had whispered lies in my ears while sitting on her throne. A throne that was built on the bloody backs of my people.

The Ndagí has trained her well, I do not recognize her.

I miss my mother. Thinking of her, my eyes fill with tears and my heart aches to call to her. Her voice used to accompany me everywhere, always right inside my head. Even before I was born I can remember her soft voice pressing images into my mind.

There is only silence now. Silence...and I’ve never felt so alone.

My whole world came crashing in that day. It was the day I left my childhood, the day transformation began.

Szora dabbed the sweat from my forehead as I fought the pains racking my body. Mother came in to take me away.

Never before had an adult entered the bed chamber of a child in transformation. And never before had a prime talent stood so near such a child and remained unaffected with the same pains.

But my mother was always an extraordinary woman. She seemed not to be made of the same fibers as the rest of our species. She took me from Szora’s care, soothed my pains with her healing magic and led me to the small Hota village by the sea.

She told me I’d be safe to change there. I didn’t know what she meant, safe? Had I not grown up in the walls of the court, surrounded by the high council and educated by the Misón himself?

What could she mean, it was not safe to transform there? What did she mean when she spoke of walls with too many minds to hear? I could not imagine that the horror of the truth would send me out here in the jungles of Tilsa, running from death and searching for life.

I reached Aaliah falls this morning. It was nice to bathe in its thundering waters; to let its power wash away the borro sap that stuck to my skin like a rash.

I hope it is not too much farther to Mashari. The terrain looks rough so I’m not sure how long it will take me. I grow weary of traveling. And I’m changing, inside I can feel it. Something is happening to me. I long to call my mother, to speak to a healer, someone...to find out what’s happening to me. I do not know if I’m becoming what I should.

*Tilsa*

If the people of the court could see me now, oh what they would think. No one would have ever believed that I would be out here, on the Tilsa planet, searching for lost cities in the jungle.

I imagine myself as they would see me--wild, completely uncivilized, my clothes tattered and torn. And the horror, that I eat raw nuts, raw fish, raw berries and roots. I make my bed by flattening the grass and using my tattered cape as a cover. There is dirt beneath my nails and a rash covers my skin from too much borro sap. My muscles have become strong from exercise and my feet tough from walking.

I look nothing like the members of court, and, indeed, that life does not seem real to me.

I picture myself walking through the courtyards surrounding the council buildings. Szora, as always by my side, we would be dressed in the finest fabrics of the twin worlds, red and gold as were the colors of the Jami.

Jami fabrics were designed to accentuate the beauty of the naked body and covered the sensitive areas only to keep them from getting dirty. They were not at all like the long Hota dresses and capes mother put me in on special occasions. Hota clothing was meant to hide the body completely, to hide the identity of the wearer, much like the garments I wore now.

And following faithfully behind us, our non-talent servants would be ready to fulfill our every wish.

Life on Marrassa, in the Temple city Oyenma, had always been one of ease. And technology couldn’t grow fast enough to keep up with the demands of Jami comfort. In fact, the Ndagí and the Misón had already begun to employ androids for their servants when I left.

Almost all the members of the high council were fleshy from hours of lazing around the gardens.

Even Szora was beginning to develop a round look, although her play kept her from becoming too fat. Her pale skin had a constant tan from the sun and her string like hair was arranged into two large braids.

Tan and fleshy had, in fact, became the fashion trend of the rich, showing that you had the time and money to do nothing but eat in the sun.

But even at an early age I found the thin bodies outside the Temple walls were a great contradiction to the easy life in the council.

I had the sensation that someone was following me today. I crossed the river and doubled back on my path to lose them. I put myself behind another day.

I don’t like to believe that Szora will become what Mother says she will. Is it not wrong to think that just because she is Jami she is evil. It seems to me that the things Mother tells me have nothing to do with Szora because they happened before either of us were born. How can I hold her responsible for what her predecessors have done.

But perhaps I am just naive. But I don’t think Szora has any need to fear me, I don’t intend on stealing her power. She’s like a sister to me.

A wampoon attacked me today. I was able to kill it before it did too much damage. My wounds have already healed, but they feel tender and sore. I don’t think that’s right.

I’ve been playing that conversation over in my head again and again. I remember it as if the words had only been spoken moments ago.

I sat on the bed holding my arms tight around my legs as if that could make the pains in my abdomen lessen. I had woken to find mother was not by my side and I was afraid to move until she returned.

The hut I was in was very small. Its mud walls seemed to hold me in too close. But it was warm and dark. A little light seeped in through the cracks in the ceiling so that I could make out the small kneeling table, just a few feet away, and the small kneeling cushions besides it. The bed I sat on was no more than a few pillows thrown together, yet it was comfortable.

I was aware of her presence seconds before the door opened. Her appearance was greatly altered. She wore her long locks loose so that they tingled with pleasure around her head. She was completely nude under a sheer red cape and her face seemed smoother, younger.

She carried a tray of food and hummed as she came in. “I just had the most glorious swim,” she said as she winked an eye at me. “But I see you are feeling better. Come, come eat.”

I rose slowly, placing the palm of my hand against my abdomen as I limped over and kneeled across from her. She had fixed my favorite dinner, red fish cooked in borro nuts.

“Where are we?” I asked her as I took a bite of the succulent meat. Its juices threatened to spill from the side of my mouth and its aroma filled my nostrils adding to the delicious taste.

“A Hota village by the sea.”

I could tell there was something she was not telling me. Even though my telepathic abilities had yet to develop, I could tell she was hiding something from me.

“Why?”

Her face became serious as she answered me, “There are too many minds at the court. Until you learn to shield your thoughts properly I won’t have you there.”

I felt that this statement was a personal attack. I wondered why I had to be whisked away in the middle of the night while Szora and her older sister, Mira, were allowed to transform there. She read my thoughts.

“Szora and Mira are Jami.” She pushed her plate from in front of her. Her dark hair became rigid with her agitation. “You must stop worshipping the Jami as you do. You’re not one of them.”

“We’re Hota, I know that. But we must work with the Jami to keep peace. The Ndagí has said…” I stopped speaking as mother stood suddenly. She was changing, as I watched I could see her changing.

Her nails grew into sharp claws, her lips became long and hard like a beak, while under the cape her body grew round and plump. Next her eyes grew big and round and her legs shrank into small thin stalks, fur and feathers covered her entire body. If I had not been watching I would not have believed it. Mother had changed so completely that she was no longer herself, but a beautiful sheller bird the same color as the red sky.

A shapeshifter, my mother “You’re Ndagí?”

Mother began to revert to her natural state as she spoke. “And why not. Do you think only the Jami can change shape? Did I raise you to think only they had the favor of the gods.” Her voice was filled with anger as she spoke.

“No mother.”

“Then you must listen to me closely, because the Jami are not what they appear to be.” She sat down. Her hair fell flat against her shoulders in a posture of sadness.

I had always thought that to be a weakness of Hota adults, their thoughts were portrayed so easily by their hair if they did not tie it on top of their heads. Then again, since we were a different species than the other nations of the twin planets we were the only ones that had this particular ability, no others could grow hair like hundreds of antenna sensing the world around them.

“Two hundreds years ago the Ndagí killed all the shapeshifters. She came in the middle of the night like a thief, like a coward. I had five siblings that she murdered.

“For some reason she chose to keep me. I had barely learned to walk then, but I became her pet. She placed controllers in my mind so she could make me do what she wanted, like a caged skarit crying for food.” She pulled her hair to the side to show the jagged scar on the edge of her scalp.

“But I got around her controls, I had you and I never let her find out you were a shapeshifter.”

“Me?” I could not hold my surprise.

Mother gave an angry laugh as she spoke, “And now the Ndagí grows old in Marrassa, hah, she can’t even see a shapeshifter forming under her own nose!”

Mother rose and walked over to the cabinet. Inside there were two boxes. She pulled out the two boxes and brought them to the table. In the first box lay a small knife with a diamond crystal in its handle. The second box held an ancient map of Tilsa and a journal documenting the history of the Hota up until the former Ndagí, Libby, had disappeared.

“There have been rumors that Libby is still alive. You must go and find her because it will take both of you to defeat the Jami when the Ndagí dies.”

“But Szora will be the next Ndagí,” I insisted, still ignorant of the meaning behind her words.

“No!” Mother slammed her fist down on the table. “We will not continue to be their playthings. Do you know what your friend Szora will do when she finds out you’re a shapeshifter?

“I blame myself, I should have not let you get so close to her. That was the Ndagí’s doing. But it’s too late to cry about that now, You must find my mother if we are going to survive.”

“Libby is your mother?” I had heard many legends and songs about the Hota shapeshifter, that turned into a bird with gills, that would sing to the night and dive into the water. But I had always thought they were only legends. I had been taught by the Jami that the only shapeshifters were Jami.

Instantly, I felt a deep anger welling up inside of me. My life had been a lie. I thought I was truly going to be part of the Jami council, but now I understood I was only meant to be their puppet just as my mother was. Only with me it would have been worse because I would have believed the lies that Szora whispered in my ears as she sat on her throne in Marrassa.

Then I came to another realization, they would see me changed. I knew I would not be able to keep my anger a secret from Szora. I was certain the Jami would kill me because I knew the truth.

“You’ll have to leave soon,” Mother said. “You must build your strength because you have to go alone. There is no one we can trust to go with you, and if I go they will surely track me with the controllers.” She handed me the boxes which contained the maps and journals. “These will help you find the way to the hidden city, Mashari.”

Mother sat quietly as she finished her meal and I could feel the calming influence of her telepathy fill me.

The pains in my stomach were still bad, but I left the next morning. I knew I would not be able to stay with that truth boiling inside me.

I studied the crystal on my knife. It bore the insignia of the Hota Nation, a woman holding the crystal of knowledge to her forehead. It was said the early Hota believed that their telepathic ability had a religious base, that it was by the blessing of the gods that they were able to see into the minds of others. Crystals represented this power because of their transparency.

I prayed on the crystal, hoping it would help me find Mashari.

I feel weak, I know the Ndagí is using her powers to slow me down. I can feel her searching for me. When I grow tired I can feel her thoughts pushing against my mind, trying to get in.

It’s too hot here. My muscles ache from cutting a path through the jungle. And the smell of the borro trees is overwhelming, pungent. Their yellow sap sticks to me like a rash. The jungle is so damp I can see the moisture hanging in the air in large drops.

I am tired of being frightened by wampoons and skarits. They are always slithering around me, always steps away from me so that I can hear their footsteps echo in my head. They’re closing in.

*Jami Dynasty*

I looked in the water and did not recognize the woman reflected back at me. Her face angular and body curved and muscular, showed almost no sign of the little girl who entered this jungle. My hair slithering wildly about my head reminded me of something ancient, something of a different fabric than the rest of my species.

*Moon last quarter*

I cut away a thick yellow stalk, then caught myself just in time to keep me from falling over the ledge. There was a large drop to the valley below and the height made my head spin.

I stepped back so there was enough room for me to kneel on the ledge and held tight to some branches to keep myself from slipping.

I scanned the valley below. Far to the right I could see the stone buildings of a temple. My hair tingled around my shoulders.

Mashari, it must be.

*Tilsa*

*Jami Dynasty*

*200 hundred years of peace*

*Moon waning crescent*

I looked around the town. It was empty. I could almost hear the sound of my footsteps echo against the ivory columns of the abandoned buildings. I doubted for a moment that this was the right place but there etched in stone read the name Mashari.

The sun came down upon me like hot breaths from an angry past. Trees that had died years ago rattled against their rotted roots. Dirt was lifted from the crumbling road to scratch at my eyes while the wind itself tore at my locks and dried the sweat on my skin.

I realized that besides myself and the wind there was no movement. It was as if even the wampoon, with their evil bite, feared this land too much to walk across it. I took a deep breath to brace myself. I had invested too much time to turn back. I needed answers.

I reached the foot of the Temple. On either side of the door were statues of some of the ancients. They were made of stone. I recognized the traditional Hota garments that they wore, the loose dresses that allowed for a lot of movement and the long capes with hoods for covering their heads. Their locks were pulled up on their heads in a style that represented refinement and wisdom. A crystalline jewel was implanted on each of their foreheads for clarity of thought and divine inspiration.

I passed through the doorway to the inner chambers. The wall was vividly colored with paintings describing the small Hota cult that had retreated here to immerse themselves in the essence of the Hota religion. It told the story of how the Jami had brought order to the warring nations through their warrior strength and shrewd leadership style.

One picture in particular caught my eye. In the center of it the crystalline stone rested in the hands of a young man. A young woman stood next to him and by her gesture, arms reaching out, it was clear that she had given him the stone. He was Jami.

I could feel my blood boil. These were lies. I knew that now. The Hota had never given their crystals to the Jami, they had been taken, through blood. I began to wonder if it was possible for Libby to be here. Surely my grandmother would not live in a place of such lies.

The painting depicted the world as peaceful, better under the Jami rule. But I now knew that was not the case. The Jami represented death, destruction.

I ran my fingers along the crystals implanted along the walls. I could feel something reverberate inside them. An image filled my mind and I realized that these crystals told a very different story than the paintings on the wall.

I could see blood, spilling from huts and flowing into the rivers. I could feel pain spread through my own body as I saw teeth rip through the sleeping bodies of men, women and children from all nations, Hota, Txousa, Rye and Mahj--all but the Jami.

The Jami would never have touched the crystals for their meaning. They wouldn’t have known that images were hidden there. I smiled as I thought how crafty my people were. The real truth was documented right here, under the nose of the Ndagí, in the ruins of an old and dying city.

*Tilsa*

*Jami Dynasty*

*200 hundred years of peace*

*Moon waning crescent*

Someone was there. I closed my eyes and I could see a face, hidden in shadow, calling to me.

My locks raised trying to sense a presence, an aura, but I could feel nothing.

I opened my eyes and headed quickly down the hall. My locks moved on my head, tasting the air.

I finally reached the main chamber of the temple. There, on a platform before the throne, was another statue. It was like those that stood out front, but different.

I stood before the stone. There was something odd about it that I could not quite place.

It looked like Libby, yes, maybe too much like Libby. Its stone eyes stared as if trying to speak, its nose slightly crinkled and lips puckered as if caught in the midst of a word.

I reached out to touch the foot of the statue. It was warm from the sun’s rays that came through the holes in the ceiling. From the sun’s rays? I wasn’t sure. There was a different quality about the warmth that seemed to come from within, like blood under skin, and the eyes continued to struggle for voice.

My hair rose again, standing at attention. I could feel something in that statue. I could sense a movement, hear a heartbeat.

The statue was alive!

But how, I wondered, how to get her out of that stone.

*Tilsa*

*Jami Dynasty*

*200 hundred years of peace*

*Moon waning crescent*

I have been sitting here for days now, trying to find a way to let Libby know that it is me who sits here. I touched the crystal in her palm and it told me how she changed herself into stone to hide from the Ndagí.

But I still have not learned the way to communicate with her. I tried kissing her lips and cheeks and caressing her hair. I screamed her name. All these attempts have failed me.

*Tilsa*

*Jami dynasty*

*200 hundred years of peace*

*Moon waning crescent*

I felt my own heart reaching like hands to strangle me. The blood raced through my body and the room began to spin around me. I turned, hearing a movement behind me.

Szora stood there with red eyes and talons pointed violently. She was beginning to change shape. I could feel her pushing in my mind like hands beating against my skull, blinding me. I struggled to push her way and I could feel the talons tearing at my skin.

I tried to focus my thoughts on the mind in the stone. It began to react, its warmth growing so strong I could feel it. Libby began to move towards us.

Then the hands stopped pushing as I fell to the ground. The blood was flowing quickly from my body and I could feel my strength fading.

A scream shattered the crystals in the walls around us. I realized the scream did not belong to me and I opened my eyes.

Szora stared in fear as the stone figure began to move towards her. “Another shapeshifter?!” I could read Szora’s thoughts, “It’s impossible,” and she knew in her youth she was no match.

Still she fought, as the Ndagí had fought; full of fear and hatred she struck out at Libby.

I could see that her attempts were in vain, but Libby did not strike back. She seemed contented just to shield herself from Szora’s mental blows.

“This is your fight, my child,” her words rang in my ears.

I nodded, understanding, and jumped to my feet. I leaped upon Szora, knocking her to the ground. And as I did I felt all the anger that had built up while I was in the jungle, all the anger and hatred I had for what the Ndagí had done to my people, for the oppression Szora planned to continue.

I hit her, violently ripping at her skin. Szora had never been a match for me physically and my travels had made me twice as strong.

I felt her struggling to reach into my mind. My anger kept her out.

Finally, I backed away from her, afraid that so many emotions would explode in me, destroying me completely. My eyes took time to clear as liquid poured from them in attempts to cool the fire that burned with in me. I looked down in time to see Szora struggle for life. Her body twisting and contorting as it tried to heal itself.

I fell to the ground, spent and overwhelmed. My tears fell faster and I began to tremble.

Then the statue stood above me, only it was real, its skin was living and a soft brown that glowed in the sunlight that burrowed through the deteriorating ceiling. She smiled warmly.

I began to heal my wounds. I could feel Libby helping with soft whispers, filling my mind, telling me what to do.

“I have waited a long time for you, granddaughter.”

The other statues began to move and come to life around me.

“You, my child, have the mark of Liberty upon you.” Libby reached down to help me stand.

*Tilsa*

Libby helped me to heal my wounds, both physically and mentally. She has not left my side even once this week, her healing powers reshaping the damage that had been done to me in the jungle. She cannot be sure what I will become, or even if I will survive my last transition.

She has been trying to teach me to heal myself. She cut her finger, then let me watch as she slowly healed it. It is important for me to know how I heal, she says, so that I will able to fix almost anything that happens to me.

But as I watched her heal, as I looked into the fabric of her being, I saw that I was not quite the same as she.

*Tilsa*

*Jami dynasty*

*200 hundred years of peace*

*Moon waning crescent*

I felt a warmth growing within me. I squeezed Libby’s hand to fight the pain. I felt her reaching to sooth me with her soft voice images as my mother once had. I was changing deep inside, I could feel the cells of my body altering into something new, something malleable.

Before my eyes I saw the pattern of a thousand lights, like stars, reach out in front of me. But these weren’t stars, they were auras of the spirit, the minds of telepaths filling the twin planets.

“That is how we see them,” Libby whispered into my ears.

I saw one light glowing in the distance, it felt familiar to me. I reached for it and found that it was my mother. As her star continued to twinkle I felt her presence strongly, as if she was standing next to me.

She was smiling, I could feel her lips press softly against my cheek.

I told her I was alright and felt my eyes water as her tears filled them.

“That’s enough for now,” Libby whispered. “You must rest.”

I turned away from the stars and opened my eyes to see Libby smiling at me.

“You’re much stronger than I could have imagined.”

*Tilsa*

*The People Nation*

*200 hundred years of terror ended*

*No moon*

The others had become statues again to hide for their protection. Libby and I stood in the center of the court yard. Around us the wind was still and the city quiet.

Libby held my hand and I felt her reaching inside me, increasing my power. The pattern appeared before me and I called to my people. One by one their minds joined with mine as Libby’s had. And I felt them, like walls in a foundation, supporting me.

I heard my mother’s voice images ring in the pattern, “This is our new Ndagí, support her and she will lead us to Liberty!”

I felt more minds join in, the Txousa, the Rye and the Mahj joining with the Hota nation, becoming my people. Their power welled with in me like a great storm that only Libby’s whispers could help me control.

Then I felt a new sensation, a presence, like something sniffing me out. There was no time left. Quickly I reached through the pattern with a mental speed I did know I was capable of. I tore at the tender flesh that connected brain to body, destroying the destroyer. The Ndagí died in Marrassa.
