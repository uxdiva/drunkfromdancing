# Beads & Sugarcane

“It’s the first t’ing I remember.” Annaise felt the comb against her scalp as Selina braided her hair. She waited patiently for Tisa to turn towards her. There were so many things she wanted Tisa to know, but this was the only way she knew how.

“I was just a lil girl then,” she began once she had Tisa attention. “Five and sum, not even tall enough to see over the gate circling the yard. The day was bright, bright so that everyt’ing was glistening.” Her hazel eyes glazed over with memory. She could smell the sweetness of sugar as it pierced the air making even the sun feel sticky as its rays touched her skin.

Her father’s shadow fell across her, seeming to engulf her like a giant banana tree, as she turned towards his towering form. His skin was brown, dark brown from the sun and his eyes were a bottomless black color that reminded Annaise of nights when there was no moon. His pores emanated the smell of cane which never washed away as if his veins were filled with his sugar instead of blood. His lips were thin yet colored a dark berry that made them more noticeable. He wore a pair of faded overalls and a straw hat to protect his head from the sun. A satchel was thrown over his back containing a jug over water and some breadpudding left over from dinner the night before.

“Gervaise,” he called to the mother inside. At least that was how Annaise thought of her. The mother was too strong, too powerful to possessed by someone as small as her. The mother was to admired and revered, even the elders and Mrs. Tate at the general store demonstrated their extreme respect calling her Madam Toussaint or simple Mamé. The only ones who called her by her given name were her parents and her husband.

“Gervaise, come nuh!” Her turned to Annaise, “Dudu go bring your mother out, we already late.”

Annaise ran back to the house, hesitating only for a moment at the front door before she stepped lightly inside. “Mamé?” she whispered.

“I can’t find me beads.” The mother stopped searching through the drawers for a moment to pear at Annaise. A nervous feeling filled her stomach as she was certain the mother knew that she had been playing with them. “Have you seen ‘em?”

“No Mamé.” Her voice barely audible as she waited for something to strike her. But how could she tell that they had fallen through the crack in the floor? She would beat her for sure. She could hear her already, her lecture made to some invisible audience., “Mal élève, but din’ I tell she don touch me beads, oui, I tell she a million times and she like she don ‘ear. Like God put those t’ings on the side of her head just to look pretty. Well, I tell the pretty miss, she touch me beads again I gon turn her rass all types of color.”

There was nothing Annaise feared more than the mother’s anger; an anger that could change the color of the sky and make the chickens turn against the wind. So rather than let the mother’s wrath shake the house down around her, she simply shook her head and waited for lightening to strike. “No, Mamé, I haven’t seen it.”

“Of course, I was just a young miss then, stupid with ignorance.” Annaise fingered the beads around her neck. “I thought they were only for conjuring a little t’ing, you know. And Mamé had millions of such t’ings in her pocket,” Annaise paused, swallowing hard. She looked into Tisa’s black eyes that were transfixed, anxious for the story to continue.

Selina, who had forgotten about braiding hair for the tale, nudge her gently. “Go on, nuh.”

Annaise nodded, feeling her child self as she sat between Selina’s legs. “If I had known, I woulda crawled right under the house and bring those beads to her. I remember Papa coming in frowning. It was one of those frowns that’s more eyebrows than mouth. It was the first time I could recall him making that particular expression. But since that day it was the only way I ever saw his face made up. I heard him call to her.”

“Gervaise, don’ you ‘ere me calling you. I out dere going mute for all my yelling.”

The mother didn’t pause from pulling the bedsheets off as she responded. “You and the pretty miss go on. I not going anywhere with out me beads.”

Her father’s eyebrows got tighter as he grab the mother’s hands as if trying to make her stay still. “You goin need more than some conjure beads if we can’t put food on the table.”

The mother made one last futile glance around their small house. Her face filled with disgust for the work awaiting her when she returned. But her eyes. Her eyes revealed some fragile part of her that Annaise had never seen. A weakness that hadn’t been their since before she was given the beads and its protective charms.

The day got even brighter. Its sugary heat swallowed up all sound. Machetes sliced through the air toppling canes with its silence. Lips moved but words refused to form, the vowels falling to their feet. Annaise sat on a pile of loose stalks watching the muscles ripple on her parents back. One hand held the stalk steady while the other brought the machete down to slice it at the root. They joined the other workers in song, yet the words still fell before reaching Annaise. A few times they would come close enough so that she could see them forming, could even make out a few letters, but they’d fall long before reaching her ears.

She looked at the sky, shading her eyes with her left hand. The day was too hot even for birds that stayed hidden in the shade of their trees or playing at the edge of the water. She wished she could play in the water. To feel it cool drops against her skin, its salt chasing away the smell of sugar. The air of what could have been a sigh if it had sound escaped from her lungs. She rolled on to her stomach--despite the discomfort of the stalks poking her-- and watched a river of ants in the march for food. She took a twig and stuck it in the stream. A few confused ants began to climb up it. When they had almost reached her fingers she dropped it smiling with terror and exhilaration.

From the corner of her eye she saw something move. She stayed still, moving her head only slightly to see better as the brown creature slithered under her. Once gone she turned back to watch the ants. A few of them were now using her twig as a look out post. The bigger guard ants using it to help defend the small workers. She began setting up more post like the twig and was amazed at how quickly the guards found them. Their antennae rattling with their communication.

Suddenly she felt her heart rattle inside of her as a scream pierced the thick air. She turned watching as the mother fell to the ground. A moment later her father brought his machete down upon the neck of a large snake. “Gervaise,” he called out, running to her side.

The other workers quickly surrounded her. Their cries “Mamé” and “Madam Toussaint” filled the air. One man, short but strong from cutting cane, ran off the fields towards the house of Mam’zelle Ti. Everything moved quickly then. They lifted the mother taking her to a more comfortable spot in the grasses along side the cane field.

“Annaise,” the mother called out to her. Annaise ran to her side pushing through legs and bodies that surround her. The mother looked at her. Her hazel eyes seeming strangely soft against her tanned skin. She reached up caressing Annaise’s cheek. “Just let me look ‘pon my pretty miss,” she whispered.

“Mamé?” Tears filled Annaise’s eyes.

“Smile, nuh. I want see my baby smile”

Annaise forced a smile as the mother squeezed her hand. She nodded approvingly, then closed her eyes.

“When Mamé died it was the loneliest time in my life. My whole world come crashin in.” Tisa moved to the floor next to Annaise taking her hands. Annaise struggled to hold the tears back, her accent even heaver as she continued, “she din have her charms so she got bit. By the time Mam’zelle Ti reached it was too late, the poison eat all she blood.”

Selina let out a big sigh as she caressed Annaise’s head. Ever since the young woman had come into her house she had felt close to her, had even began to think of her as a daughter. She had come like her own lost, needing to be filled. There was a pain in her that was so much like Selina’s that it had pulled them to each other. Now learning where the pain came from she leaned forward putting her arms around Annaise to express her own love.
