# The Nest

Born the day she left her mother's nest

Wing stretched wide to greet the wind

Unteathers, unbound

Constrained only be the day and night

by the seasons

as the earth rotated in its orbit beneath her



She went on this way for some time

Sun warming her face

Rain washing her body

A creature of the air

She had found her freedom



But in her freedom was

loneliness

She wanted most what her 

mother had had

and her mother had had

and all the mothers from time beginning



So gathered twigs and leaves

and built her nest in a place

high up and save

Teathered there to 

the children she created

she found joy



There she loved them

nurtured them

and waited for the breeze

that would stretch their wings

towards freedom
